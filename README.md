# AITL Animation Demos

This repository contains **experimental web animation demos** for visualizing concepts related to **AITL (PID × FSM × LLM)**.

These demos are intended as **supplemental materials** and **technical experiments**,  
not as production-ready components.

---

## Purpose

- Explore how animation can support conceptual understanding
- Evaluate suitability of web animations for educational materials
- Test ideas separately from the main AITL portal

---

## Scope

- Simple CSS-based animations
- Lightweight JavaScript demos (when necessary)
- Concept visualization rather than visual polish

---

## Non-Goals

- No production-quality UI
- No performance optimization
- No guarantee of long-term maintenance

---

## Relation to Main Portal

This repository is **independent** from the main AITL portal and exists only as a  
sandbox for experimentation.

Main portal:  
https://samizo-aitl.github.io/

## Notes

- Demos may change, break, or be removed without notice
- Some experiments may never be adopted into the main materials
